i have an art instagram

i made it in lock down

it currently has 2 followers

* my sister
* my friend

its suppose to be anonymous so i feel like they've blown my cover

<p>&nbsp;</p>

i want to block them

but then id have no followers

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
   

my nan followed it

i blocked her

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

the last thing i posted on my normal instagram was in year 9

<p>&nbsp;</p>

it was of notting hill carnival

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

i was desperite to leave

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

sometimes ill get close to posting again

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

usually because im hanging out with cool art school friends

i want show them off

without showing off

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

but if post them does that mean i have to post my actual pre-uni south london friends

<p>&nbsp;</p>

i dont want to be associated

they are hooligans that im not proud of

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

also what happens if nan starts following that account

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
